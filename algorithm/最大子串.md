Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

最长，且没有重复字符的子串


hasMap记录遍历过的元素和位置
如果当前当前重复元素大于start，则下次查找点start就是从当前位置开始重新
```
func findMaxSlice(s string) int{
	start := 0
	max := 0
	hasMap := make(map[byte]int)

	for i,b := range []byte(s){
		if c, ok := hasMap[b];ok && c >= start{
			start = i
		}
		if i - start + 1 > max{
			max = i- start +1
		}
		hasMap[b] = i
	}
	return max
}
```
